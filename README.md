# csci_6221
Repository for the CSCI 6221 project, which demonstrates capabilities of the programming language Go.

## TODO - add more comprehensive information here once our project goals are clearer.

Right now we are trying to build an image/video processor that lets you apply filters and modify them. With the naturally parallel nature of 
images as arrays of pixels, and videos as arrays of images, there is a lot of scope to show the functionality of Go as a language
for parallel computation using channels and goroutines.
