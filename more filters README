I did some work straightly on the basis of Chui's file
You can see them from line 15 to 21
Every line is a kind of operation
Other part is totally same as Chui's previous work
At the same line behind the code, there are explanations for each operation
btw it may spends a bit much time running some of them
I'll keep finding some other potential filters after finishing my 6461 proj
lmk via dc if you need more infor or require me to do some change to it
